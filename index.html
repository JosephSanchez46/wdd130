            <p>Nicaragua is a country located in central America. Nicaragua is often called the "land of volcanic lakes." And the Concepci√≥n volcano, which rises on the lake island of Ometepe, can help explain why.Nicaragua also has two UNESCO-recognized World Heritage Sites, the ruins of Le√≥n Viejo and the Le√≥n Cathedral, and two UNESCO-recognized cultural and intangible assets, the language, music and culture of the Garifunas and the G√ºeg√ºense.</p>
